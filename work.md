In the Fall of 2024 I participated in the **Notre Dame Washington Program,** where I interned for **Senator Kyrsten Sinema.**

## 🎥 Notre Dame Studios

I work as a **Live Production Student Employee** at Notre Dame Studios/Fighting Irish Media, where I've filmed for a variety of broadcasts and in-venue productions ranging from football and basketball to track and men's boxing.

Below is a clip from the Bengal Bouts boxing tournament finals in 2025, where I operated a hand-held camera on the ring and was knocked off during a match.
